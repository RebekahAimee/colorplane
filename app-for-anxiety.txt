Phone app for anxiety... paint the screen a color
You paint the whole screen with whatever color the app assigns you, and then you start over 
with a different color.
If you like one of the colors, the app can save an image of the color and its hex code to 
your gallery. If you dislike one of the colors, you can press a button for a new one and 
the app won't use that color again. You can also skip colors if you don't like a combination
or whatever.
Other options: colorblindness; blue mode (for red/green colorblindness), timeout mode (for
if you can't find that last pixel or whatever, if you don't get it within ten minutes it'll
just switch to a different color). Different palettes--brights, pastels, muted, natural,
gem tones...
Blacklist certain colors, whitelist others to get palettes that include them
I want to make this free, with no ads but a donation box.
I think I'll call it "Color Wall" or something.
